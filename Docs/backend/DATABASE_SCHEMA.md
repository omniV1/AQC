## üîó Data Relationships Explained

### User ‚Üí Client Relationship (1:1)
- Every Client record must link to exactly one User record
- The User record stores login info, the Client record stores postpartum-specific info
- Example: Sarah Johnson has User account + Client profile

### User ‚Üí Provider Relationship (1:1)
- Every Provider record must link to exactly one User record  
- The User record stores login info, the Provider record stores professional info
- Example: Mary Smith has User account + Provider profile

### Provider ‚Üí Client Relationship (1:Many)
- One Provider (doula) can be assigned to multiple Clients
- One Client can only have one assigned Provider at a time
- The assignment is stored in both:
  - `Client.assignedProvider` field
  - `Provider.clients[]` array

### Example Data Flow:
1. Sarah registers ‚Üí Creates User record with role="client"
2. Sarah completes intake ‚Üí Creates Client record linked to her User
3. System assigns Mary (provider) ‚Üí Updates both Client.assignedProvider and Provider.clients[]
