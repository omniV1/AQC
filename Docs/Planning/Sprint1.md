## Technical Considerations

### Architecture Overview
The platform will be built using a modern stack consisting of React frontend, Java Spring Boot backend, and PostgreSQL database. This architecture provides the security, reliability, and flexibility needed for this sensitive application.

### Security Approach
Given the nature of postpartum information, security is paramount. We will implement:
- End-to-end encryption for all communications
- JWT-based authentication with proper token handling
- Secure password policies and storage
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

### Integration Points
This sprint will require integration with:
- Calendar APIs for appointment scheduling
- Email/SMS services for notifications
- Cloud storage for resource management
- Content delivery network for media assets

---

## Development Approach

### Sprint Workflow
1. **Planning**: Requirements clarification and task breakdown (complete)
2. **Design**: UI/UX mockups and technical design documents (2 days)
3. **Development**: Feature implementation with daily standups (8 days)
4. **Testing**: Unit, integration, and UI testing (3 days)
5. **Review**: QA and demo preparation (1 day)
6. **Demo**: Stakeholder presentation and feedback (1 day)

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all business logic (minimum 80% coverage)
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- UI component testing with React Testing Library
- End-to-end testing of critical user flows
- Accessibility testing (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)

---

## Definition of Done

A user story is considered "Done" when:
1. All acceptance criteria have been implemented and verified
2. Code has been peer-reviewed and approved
3. Unit and integration tests are passing
4. UI/UX matches approved designs
5. Feature has been tested on multiple devices/browsers
6. Documentation has been updated
7. The feature has been demoed to and accepted by the Product Owner
