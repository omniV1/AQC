# TECHNICAL INTEGRATION DETAILS

### **API Contracts**
```typescript
// Resource Service API Endpoints
GET    /api/resources/recommendations/{userId}
POST   /api/resources/{resourceId}/interaction
GET    /api/content/templates
POST   /api/content/publish
GET    /api/analytics/user-engagement

// Main Platform Integration Endpoints  
POST   /api/users/sync-profile
GET    /api/users/{userId}/preferences
POST   /api/auth/validate-token
```

### **Data Models Coordination**
- **User Profile Schema:** Synchronized between services
- **Resource Categories:** Standardized taxonomy across platforms
- **Interaction Events:** Common tracking schema for analytics
- **Care Plan Structure:** Compatible template format

### **Authentication Flow**
1. User authenticates with main LUNARA platform
2. JWT token includes resource service access claims
3. Resource service validates token with main platform
4. User profile data synchronized automatically
5. Single logout invalidates tokens across services

# RISK MANAGEMENT

### **Technical Risks & Mitigation**

**Risk:** API integration complexity  
**Mitigation:** Early prototype development and testing sandbox  
**Contingency:** Simplified integration with manual data transfer fallback  

**Risk:** Andrew's timeline pressure  
**Mitigation:** Phased development with MVP milestones  
**Contingency:** Reduced scope to core features only  

**Risk:** Service coordination challenges  
**Mitigation:** Regular integration testing and shared testing environments  
**Contingency:** Temporary manual data sync while debugging integration  

### **Project Coordination Risks**

**Risk:** Communication gaps between teams  
**Mitigation:** Structured weekly meetings and shared documentation  
**Contingency:** Daily check-ins during critical integration phases  

**Risk:** Dependency blocking  
**Mitigation:** Clear API contracts and mock services for development  
**Contingency:** Parallel development with integration testing phase
