## Functional Requirements

### Use Cases

Describe the sequence of functional actions a project performs with either textual Use Cases, UML Use Case diagrams, or if using Scrum, provide a link to the User Stories (see template included in course materials).

**NOTE:** Once the functional requirements have been completed, there may be situations where Use Cases or User Stories may need to be taken out of scope, possibly due to technical challenges or timeline challenges. Any Use Cases or User Stories that are taken out of scope once the project development has started must be approved by the mentor and instructor with justification as to why the functionality is being removed from the project. The following must be updated if any Use Cases or User Stories are taken out of scope:

| **Use Case or User Story** | **Approval Date** | **Justification** |
|----------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
|                            |                   |                   |

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Use Cases

Describe the sequence of non-functional actions a project performs with either textual Use Cases, UML Use Case diagrams, or if using Scrum, provide a link to the User Stories (see template included in course materials).

**NOTE:** Once the non-functional requirements have been completed, there may be situations where Use Cases or User Stories may need to be taken out of scope, possibly due to technical challenges or timeline challenges. Any Use Cases or User Stories that are taken out of scope once the project development has started must be approved by the mentor and instructor with justification as to why the functionality is being removed from the project. The following must be updated if any Use Cases or User Stories are taken out of scope:

| **Use Case or User Story** | **Approval Date** | **Justification** |
|----------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
|                            |                   |                   |

## Technical Requirements

### Use Cases

Describe the tools and technologies used in the project.

**NOTE:** Once the technical requirements have been completed, there may be situations where technologies or tools may need to be taken out of scope or changed, possibly due to technical challenges or timeline challenges. Any technologies or tools that are taken out of scope or changed once the project development has started must be approved by the mentor and instructor with justification as to why the functionality is being removed from the project. The following must be updated if any technologies or tools are taken out of scope or changed:

| **Technology or Tool** | **Approval Date** | **Justification** |
|------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
|                        |                   |                   |
