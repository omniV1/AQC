              I became passionate about postpartum care through my own experiences of navigating birth and the postpartum season three times. Each journey taught me invaluable lessons about the importance of support, self-care, and community during this transformative time.
            </p>
            <p className="text-brown/90 leading-relaxed mt-4">
              Currently pursuing certification as a postpartum doula through DONA International, I now offer non-clinical support to families in West Valley. My focus is on holistic, intuitive, and sustainable care. I believe everyone deserves to feel nurtured and supported in early parenthood.
